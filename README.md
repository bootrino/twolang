# twolang

Two is a new programming language developed in 2018 by Andrew Stuart.

Two's core rationale is to address the bloat of modern programming languages.

Modern programming languages are often feature heavy and as a result slow to run and carry the burden of many years of feature bloat.

You can think of Two as a "risc programming language" - one in which all the years of bloat and compatibility hacks have been peeled away to leave only the core value in place.

Two is Turing Complete, understandable for beginners and powerful enough to satisfy the most experienced developers.

As a new language, Two lacks the library support of its modern competitors but we expect this will come soon enough.

Two tends to referred to as Twolang because the author of the language wanted a cool name and felt one of the core words of the English language appropriate but failed to give much though to search engines and searchability so the cool and minimalist name 'Two' tends now to be a dorky and meaningless 'Twolang'.
